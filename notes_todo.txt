This works but then all the historic data is public.  Not sure that SM would be happy with this.  


TODO
---------
One possibility is to do a password protected page in the app that has links to the github page jsons 
OR put in an S3 bucket and server from there.  Could perhaps have as password protected there.

Need to review the Jupyter notebooks now have a new endpoint for tableau(2 below)
Might need another API endpoint for current seasons from specific date for option 2



Have tweaked the API.  Now two main endpoints:

1/.    1 line per match.            line contains home stats and aways stats 
2/     1 line per teammatchstat     line is one team per match.   (this is better for Power BI and tableau)
